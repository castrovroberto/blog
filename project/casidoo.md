Cassidy Williams' website, [cassidoo.co](https://cassidoo.co/), exemplifies a minimalist and developer-friendly design. Here's a detailed breakdown of its design elements:

### üñãÔ∏è Typography

* **Font Family**: The site utilizes a sans-serif font stack:

  ```css
  font-family: "Helvetica Neue", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
  ```

### üé® Color Palette

* **Background & Text**: The default theme features a white background with black text, providing high contrast and simplicity.

* **Accent Color**: An accent color of `#ccff00` (a bright lime green) is used to highlight interactive elements like checkboxes, radio buttons, and progress bars, leveraging the CSS `accent-color` property .

* **Dark Mode**: The site includes a dark mode toggle, which applies a black background with white text when activated. This is managed by adding a `.dark-mode` class to the `<body>` element and adjusting styles accordingly .
