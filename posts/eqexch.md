> "Some people dream of success, while others wake up and work hard at it." Napoleon Hill

As I was reading these words in the classic book **Think and grow rich** by Napoleon Hill. 
I realized that a key part of any success in life is the ugly part that in many occasions is rarely spoken about. 
The struggle, the pain, the long hours, and the failures all those amount almost even proportion that the success events we often hear about.

**What am I willing to give away in order to be successful?**

Is quite a hard question to be honest, with no definitive answer; a stable job, material posessions, quality time with family and friends, my mental health perhaps.
I think of many ways I can counter these risks, exercise, or meditation.
At the end I can always adjust or get used to... Using boxing as an example, any boxer willing to get up in the ring, must be prepared to recieve some punches.
Some of them will be avoided, or countered, eventually some of them will be soaked as as hard as it can possibly be and I am pretty sure I will be knocked down.

Finally, asking myself what am I willing to give away every morning is a poweful way to keep me and my ego grounded, to focus in the process and not too much on the end goal.
