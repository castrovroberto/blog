> "I cant do this anymore!"

That is what I said to my boss one Monday morning, after not being able to sleep during almost the whole weekend. 

The circumstances of that event, I could trace them back even to my first job almost 7 years ago, I just realized it was not sustainable anymore.

The toll I was taking on my physical and mental health was simply too heavy, and it accumulated for too long. I felt cornered, claustrophobic and desperate. It just exploded directly into my face.

I'm still trying to figure it out what to learn from this experience, but what I do certainly know is that working for the sake of it, doing things because you love doing them, far outweighs the money aspect of it.

**Mr. Money Mustache** [@mrmoneymustache](https://twitter.com/mrmoneymustache) kinda opened my already squinting eyes when he stated in [his talk for the 2016 World Domination Summit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-Li_sFNc4Q):
> "Work is better when you don't need the money".

I will put it as a question to myself. **How would my work look like if I didn't need the money?** I do not know at this point but at least I know that I will commit myself to figure it out.
