I’ve always been dealing with procrastination in different ways, specially when I don’t feel invested in something or its intrinsic goal, or at least when I fail to recognize it. But, I don’t think that it is necessarily a bad thing.

However, the kind of procrastination I am most concerned about is when the things I am procrastinating on, are those that I certainly know that I must work on that will have a direct positive impact in my life. Like exercising, reading, or working in my interests…  **But why?**

The five minute rule, in my own words, is **to commit to do something for at least 5 minutes…** forget what might happen afterwards, just focus on that task for 5 minutes. This mindset for me _gamifies_ it a little, and reduces the friction to get started.

It feels uncomfortable at first, but at least after getting started I try to recognize and embrace that uneasiness.

For me as a Software Engineer, there are some thing that I avoid doing, and some others I’m able to enter a ‘_flow_’ state almost immediately. Finding that balance is also a key part of my productivity framework.

At the end what I want is consistency. I want to be consistent. That is where the ‘_No-Zero Days_’ mantra comes in. These are my actionable steps for a healthy productivity framework:

1.  Recognize resistance to start and embrace it.
2.  Apply the  _‘five-minute’_  rule.
3.  Sort and plan your tasks.
4.  Remember the end goal.
5.  Consistency.
6.  Rest.

This definitely has helped me create a routine along side my day 8 to 5 job.

My name is Roberto Castro, I’m a Software Engineer from Costa Rica. Like most of us I think I’m still figuring a lot of things out and writing is a way to articulate my thoughts for clarity.

I write about my personal journey as a self-learning  _enthusiast_, philosophy  _consumer_, personal-finance  _day-dreamer_, human-experience  _participant_, aspiring  _entrepreneur_, basketball  _air-baller_, and productivity  _try-hard_.
