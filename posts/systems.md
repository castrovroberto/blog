> "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Your goal is your desired outcome." James Clear

This is the first quote that comes to my mind every time I remind myself to my new found goal. I know for sure that I had goals in the past that for different reasons, I did not accomplished. In essence, goals by themselves are not precisely what I need necessarily to reach them. 

I have listened to the [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) by James Clear audio book a couple of times already, and I really start to grasp that no matter your goals are, if you don't build a system designed to help you reach it, it won't work most of the time.

There is a lot of examples and comparisons between systems and goals in real life, I would like to let my mind wonder jumping from one example to another. At the end, I have to make sure that the tools I use, the habits I build and the direction that those efforts point towards are in the direction of my goals.

In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK1fXca3-qQ) with one of my favorite You-Tubers Matt D'avella, almost three years ago by now, is definitely one of my go-to interviews when I want to refresh some of the teachings of the Atomic Habits.

One final question for myself: **How my systems would look like if I already accomplished my goal?**
