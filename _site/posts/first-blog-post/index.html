        <p>A few months ago, I found out I’m going to be a dad. And ever since, my world has shifted — not in the dramatic, movie-like sense, but in the subtle way that makes you pay closer attention. To routines. To dreams. To what kind of world you want to build, and who you want to build it for.</p>
<p>As someone who spends a lot of time immersed in code, it’s surreal to look at a tiny ultrasound and realize this is the most complex and beautiful thing I’ll ever be part of, and needless to say that I do not feel prepared for.</p>
<p>My tech interests haven’t faded — if anything, they’ve deepened. I’m more motivated than ever to learn, to simplify, to create tools that matter. I find myself dreaming up ideas that could help families, small businesses, or even just the version of me trying to balance work and a growing family. My side projects now carry a little extra weight — not just to push boundaries, but to leave something meaningful behind.</p>
<p>This blog will be a mix of things. Bits of code. Bits of life. I’ll write about experiments with Rust or Java, ideas for digital tools, and maybe even some thoughts on raising a kid in a tech-saturated world. No big promises — just a place to share what I’m learning, and what I care about.</p>
<p>Thank you for being here. I’m excited to see where this all goes — with my keyboard in one hand, and (soon enough) my daughter in the other.</p>
